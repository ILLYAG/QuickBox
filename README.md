In all seriousness, we are growing considerably.. as in.. really fast. With the growth comes a few pains along the way. It has been requested by several members who wish to contribute that we simplify our repos to make things easier, so I says "Hey, I'll just combine all this non-sesne and it'll make my life easier too!"

### /FIN!

I love you guys and to avoid any weirdness and confusion, could you guys update our README link to ::
```
https://quickbox.io/readme-md/
```
That'd be super duper! :D
